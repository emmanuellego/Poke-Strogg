1. LIMITED USE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT or What You Can and Cannot Do With
the Full Version of Quake II.


CAN DO:
-- Play & enjoy the single player game;
-- Setup a full version based server on a not-for-profit basis;
-- Develop new levels and/or level creation utilities; and
-- Play the game and/or setup a full version based server using
   a user-developed level.

   see Commercial Exploitation License info below;

   Example: Game names, logos, game graphics, etc.; or

2. THE SIMPLE RULES REGARDING THE SALE OF USER DEVELOPED QUAKE II LEVELS
AND/OR UTILITIES:

-- User-developed/user-modified maps & utilities can only work with the full
   version of Quake II.  (Just to be crystal clear on this point: user-
   developed/user-modified maps & utilities cannot work with the demo or any
   version of Quake II other than the full version.) 

-- Maps/utilities that are made for Quake II cannot be rented, sold or
   commercially exploited by any other means.  The full version Limited Use
   Software License Agreement will give you the limited right to develop
   maps/utilities that use id data.  This limited right does not include the
   right for anyone to sell anything that includes id data or any other id
   property.

3. COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION LICENSE FOR QUAKE II

If you are interested in trying to make money using the full version of Quake
II (not allowed using the demo) you must sign our easy-to-digest Commercial
Exploitation License.  This license is to be used by folks desiring to use
the full version of Quake II to set up pay-per-play (location based orarcade
centers) stations, for profit online servers, or other applications where
the actual code or graphics from the full version of Quake II is used for
profit.  Of course, id does not give any warranty or representations as to
whether you will make any profit.  You assume 100% of the risk.  

This is a license that allows you to run Quake II for a profit through a cer-
tain monthly gross profit range without payment to id Software other that
the initial $500 processing fee.  If your Quake II-related business becomes
successful the agreement brings id into the revenue stream.

Basic terms of the commercial exploitation license:

-- License grants a commercial exploitation right for the full version of
   Quake II as a whole without payment to id Software (except for the $500
   processing fee) so long as the monthly gross revenue from Quake II 
   $5,000.00 or below.  You must make a nonrefundable and nonrecoupable pay-
   ment of $500 for the costs of processing the license.

-- License provides for a 12.5% royalty to be paid to id software in months
   where the licensee's Quake II related monthly gross revenue is above
   $5,000.00.  For those months, you will be obligated to pay on 100% of your
   monthly gross revenue.

-- Royalty is based off net income.  The term "Net Income" shall mean all
   revenue received by you as Licensee from the commercial use of Quake II, 
   less only actual, reasonable and necessary documented costs relating
   directly to such use.

-- License expressly prohibits commercial exploitation via the sale (retail
   or otherwise) of any versions of Quake II.

-- License expressly prohibits advertising/marketing use of our copyrighted,
   trademarked, or other properties.

-- This license is not intended for use by folks developing Quake II maps
   and/or utilities.   Please reference the section titled "The simple rules
   for Quake II map/utility distribution:" for info on this subject.

If you would like enter into the agreement, please type a written explana-
tion of how you intend to commercially exploit Quake II and send your check
or money order (please do not send cash) to:

                id Software
                18601 LBJ #666
                Mesquite, TX  75150
                Attn: Quake II ComExp License

We will then review your request and, if acceptable, will mail you two
originals of the agreement for execution and return.  You have no rights
until such time as id executes and delivers to you an original of the
Commercial Exploitation License.  If we choose not to accept your request,
we will refund your $500 processing fee.

The terms of the license are not subject to negotiation. If you cannot
live with the terms spelled out in the license do not engage in any com-
mercial exploitation or other use of Quake II and do not send us the money
or requests for an agreement.
